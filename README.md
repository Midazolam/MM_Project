HTML
Using XHTML and CSS we built a website consisting of four pages.
	/html/index.html
	/html/flag.html
	/html/media.html
	/html/drivers.html
	/html/css/style.css
The website has embedded images made using Fireworks / Photoshop.
	/html/images/body_bg.jpg
	/html/images/logo.jpg
It also has a .gif (we could have used the .swf file, but we wanted to keep our objects mobile friendly). This was created using Adobe Flash CC (Trial Edition).
	/html/images/banner.gif
	/html/flash_workings/

Phonegap
Our app was written in plain HTML and CSS. It was then compiled to a .apk with Phonegap.
	/android/platforms/android/ant-build/
It also contained images we edited using Fireworks / Photoshop.
	/android/www/images/ch.png
	/android/www/images/bg.jpg
It was deployed to the Slide Me marketplace
